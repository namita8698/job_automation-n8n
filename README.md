# job_automation-n8n

This project is part of my Generative AI assignment (Part 2), focused on showcasing how automation and AI can simplify real-world workflows. The idea is to reduce the repetitive tasks involved in job applications by combining workflow automation with AI-powered text generation.

The solution uses n8n as the central automation platform and integrates multiple tools:

SerpAPI (Google Jobs) → fetches live job listings based on keywords and filters

Gemini → evaluates job relevance, scores opportunities, and generates tailored cover letters

Google Sheets → stores structured job data for easy tracking and review

Gmail → sends a daily email digest of the top job matches with cover letters included

With this workflow, job seekers no longer need to manually search, copy details, or draft repetitive applications. Instead, everything is handled automatically — from finding opportunities to preparing a personalized application package.

The project demonstrates the power of low-code automation combined with AI, making the job search process more efficient, consistent, and scalable.
